# OBL-MIX
an "Obelisk" replacement for STS Serge systems/boats

This is a simple processor style mixer with manual offset to replace an Obelisk power panel with something a bit more useful. 
Power distribution is via 3.96mm headers on the back so adapters have to be made from those to Serge-style AMP connectors. 
(the vertical PCB mount AMP connectors are simply too big to use)

To make power harness adaptors:

FROM OBL-MIX:
Wafer Connector 3.96mm 4 Pins SKU A-778 (tayda)
Crimp Terminal Connector 3.96mm SKU A-803 (tayda)
Housing Connector 3.96mm 4 Pins SKU A-796 (tayda)

TO STS SERGE: 
Female crimp socket 770146-1 (mouser, digikey)
Receptable M 7700751 (mouser, digikey)

Everything here is used at your own risk, no 

There are optional "power good" LED indicators on the PCB that are NOT implemented on the panel design.
